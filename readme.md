Following the architecture phases, the repo is structured in 3 main part (and so folders):
- Data Preprocessing that include both the data preprocessing of the user and the knowledge extraction phase.
- LLM repo that include both code for perform fine-tuning and inference on the model
- Output refinement and metric calculation
